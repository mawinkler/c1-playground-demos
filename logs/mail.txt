Hi Folks,

I'm happy to announce new security controls are now deployed to all of our 
Kubernetes clusters.

In a nutshell the following policy is now enforced by default:

- Pods must not run in host namespaces.
- Containers must not run as root and can't be privileged.
- The single image source is our private registry.
- All images needs to be version tagged. Latest is not advised and will
  create a security event.
- All images are required to be scanned for security issues.

The security office is aware of the fact, that images with zero vulnerabilities
are sometimes hard to achieve. To ensure the availability of services we
decided to not simply block deployment on every vulnerability but to
incorporate the attack vector, complexitity and some more specifics before
blocking a deployment.

If you have any question or encounter problems please contact us.

Regards,
Security
